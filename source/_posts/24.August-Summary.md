# Preface

  How Time flies!

August is ended.
I feel like I have done nothing in August.

I want to be deep at information security techniques , but it is so hard .
At first I should focus on a direction , hard to choose , I can not give up anything ,maybe I don't need to choose. I can learn everything as it was needed.

I want to play RE,focus on windows programming ,but hard ,so hard to see the outcome .

So I will still be sticked ,for a long time ,maybe a life time .
I am trying to move on.
**Don't wanna give up.**
_And don't wanna try too hard._
