# Preface

I am feeling down , for quite a long time.

English is so hard to learn, so hard to use , I almost  give up.
Making money is so hard.

But don't give up hope.
Because hope is free.
Take a deep breath.


# Things I do in September

1. Read some bit of  《RICH DAD POOR DAD》 
2. Almost nothing.
3. The VPS I am using is blocked , so sad ,and now is  slow to connect.
