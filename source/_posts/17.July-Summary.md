# Preface

I want to improve  my English reading speed.
Cuz I feel like my English level is like a kingdergarden student. 

Actually I am so lazy and have no method . Maybe I will give up sooner or later.

**Maybe I should log on Quora to post some answers.**

Recently , I read Tinyfools English learning post , which is very important and good . A true hearted article.
He is a fat guy who recently focusing on advertising , but his article is sometimes good.
BTW,he was divorced and now has a young beautiful girlfriend.
